  The Flutter tool might occasionally download resources
  from Google servers. By downloading or using the
  Flutter SDK you agree to the [Google Terms of Service][].

  For example, when installed from GitHub
  (as opposed to from a prepackaged archive),
  the Flutter tool downloads the Dart SDK from
  Google servers immediately when first run,
  as it is used to execute the `flutter` tool itself.
  This also occurs when Flutter is upgraded
  (for example, by running the `flutter upgrade` command).

  The `flutter` tool uses Google Analytics
  to report feature usage statistics and send [crash reports][].
  This data is used to help improve Flutter tools over time.

  Flutter tool analytics are not sent on the very first run.
  To disable reporting, run `flutter config --no-analytics`.
  To display the current setting, use `flutter config`.
  If you opt out of analytics, an opt-out event is sent,
  and then no further information is sent by the Flutter tool.
  
  Dart tools might also send usage metrics and crash
  reports to Google.
  To control the submission of these metrics,
  use the following options on the [`dart` tool][]:

   * `--enable-analytics`: Enables anonymous analytics.
   * `--disable-analytics`: Disables anonymous analytics.

  The Google [Privacy Policy][] describes
  how data is handled by these services.
