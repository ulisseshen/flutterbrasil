### Additional Windows requirements

{% include_relative _help-link.md location='win-desktop' %}

For Windows desktop development,
you need the following in addition to the Flutter SDK:

* [Visual Studio 2022][] or [Visual Studio Build Tools 2022][]
  When installing Visual Studio or only the Build Tools,
  you need the "Desktop development with C++" workload installed
  for building windows, including all of its default components. 

{{site.alert.note}}
  **Visual Studio** is different than Visual Studio _Code_.
