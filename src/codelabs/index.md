title: Codelabs & workshops
description: "Codelabs and workshops help you quickly get started programming Flutter."
---

The Flutter codelabs provide a guided,
hands-on coding experience. Some codelabs
run in DartPad&mdash;no downloads required!

Flutter workshops are similar to the codelabs,
but are instructor led and always use DartPad.
The provided workshop link takes you to the relevant YouTube video,
which tells you where to find the associated DartPad link.

  You might want to check out the workshops
  created by our Google Developer Experts (GDEs).
  You can find them on the [Flutter community blog][].

## Good for beginners

If you're new to Flutter, we recommend starting with
one of the following codelabs:

* [Building your first Flutter app][] (workshop)<br>
  An instructor-led version of our very popular
  "Write your first Flutter app" codelab
  (listed below).

* [Your first Flutter app][]<br>
  Create a simple app that automatically generates cool-sounding names,
  such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine".
  This app is responsive and runs on mobile, desktop, and web.
  (This also replaces the previous "write your first Flutter app"
  for mobile, part 1 and part 2 codelabs.)

* [Write your first Flutter app on the web][]<br>
  Implement a simple web app in DartPad (no downloads
  required!) that displays a sign-in screen
  containing three text fields. As the user fills out the
  fields, a progress bar animates along the top of the
  sign-in area. This codelab is written specifically for
  the web, but if you have downloaded and configured
  Android and iOS tooling, the completed app
  works on Android and iOS devices, as well.
